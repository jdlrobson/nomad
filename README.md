#Nomad

I'm building the travel guide I need.
It needs to work offline.
It needs to inspire me.
It needs to make travelling easier because more of us need to travel.

You are welcome to join me, but please be warned, the code is bad and we'll need to rewrite it as soon as we've worked out what we're building.

The world needs a better travel guide as humans were not meant to stand still.
